## About

### What I Learned

This project was another big step in my frontend knowledge. Understanding how to use a service such as firebase and utilise it for this project was extremely beneficial and I can see it being my go to backend service until I begin to delve into creating my own backend. Aside from that, this project helped further cement my knowledge of react and using react router appropriately. Using asynchronous code through fetching data from firebase also allowed me to add loading states to the levels in the project. Which was always something I had wanted to do. This project also had a larger amount of components to deal with than I was used to so structuring certain components to conditionally render the correct one based on state proved slightly unwieldy at times but was a great learning experience.

### What I would do differently
While appropriate for this project, building out the app made me see the downsides of using lots of setState hooks. I sometimes forgot what each piece of state did and made things such as naming harder than they needed to be. I would definitely like to delve into better state management in future projects. I've already begun looking into more advanced hooks such as useReducer and use/provideContext so I hope to include these in my next complex project.
